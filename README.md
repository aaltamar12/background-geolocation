# Background Geolocation
Capacitor plugin which lets you receive geolocation updates even while the app is backgrounded.
Tested with Capacitor v2. iOS and Android platforms only.

## Usage

```javascript
import {Plugins} from "@capacitor/core";
const {BackgroundGeolocation, Modals} = Plugins;

// To start listening for changes in the device's location, add a new watcher.
// You do this by calling 'addWatcher' with an options object and a callback. An
// ID is returned, which can be used to remove the watcher in the future. The
// callback will be called every time a new location is available. Watchers can
// not be paused, only removed. Multiple watchers may exist at the same time.
const watcher_id = BackgroundGeolocation.addWatcher(
    {
        // If the "backgroundMessage" option is defined, the watcher will
        // provide location updates whether the app is in the background or the
        // foreground. If it is not defined, location updates are only
        // guaranteed in the foreground. This is true on both platforms.

        // On Android, a notification must be shown to continue receiving
        // location updates in the background. This option specifies the text of
        // that notification.
        backgroundMessage: "Cancel to prevent battery drain.",

        // The title of the notification mentioned above. Defaults to "Using
        // your location".
        backgroundTitle: "Tracking You.",

        // Whether permissions should be requested from the user automatically,
        // if they are not already granted. Defaults to "true".
        requestPermissions: true,

        // If "true", stale locations may be delivered while the device
        // obtains a GPS fix. You are responsible for checking the "time"
        // property. If "false", locations are guaranteed to be up to date.
        // Defaults to "false".
        stale: false,

        // The minimum number of metres between subsequent locations. Defaults
        // to 0.
        distanceFilter: 50
    },
    function callback(location, error) {
        if (error) {
            if (error.code === "NOT_AUTHORIZED") {
                Modals.confirm({
                    title: "Location Required",
                    message: (
                        "This app needs your location, " +
                        "but does not have permission.\n\n" +
                        "Open settings now?"
                    )
                }).then(function ({value}) {
                    if (value) {
                        // It can be useful to direct the user to their device's
                        // settings when location permissions have been denied.
                        // The plugin provides 'openSettings' to do exactly
                        // this.
                        BackgroundGeolocation.openSettings();
                    }
                });
            }
            return console.error(error);
        }

        return console.log(location);
    }
);

// When a watcher is no longer needed, it should be removed by calling
// 'removeWatcher' with an object containing its ID.
BackgroundGeolocation.removeWatcher({
    id: watcher_id
});

// The location object.

    // Longitude in degrees.

}

// If you just want the current location, try something like this. The longer
// the timeout, the more accurate the guess will be. I wouldn't go below about
// 100ms.
function guess_location(callback, timeout) {
    let last_location;
    let id = Plugins.BackgroundGeolocation.addWatcher(
        {
            requestPermissions: false,
            stale: true
        },
        function (location) {
            last_location = location || undefined;
        }
    );

    setTimeout(function () {
        callback(last_location);
        Plugins.BackgroundGeolocation.removeWatcher({id});
    }, timeout);
}
```

### Typescript support

```typescript
// Capacitor 2.x
import {
    BackgroundGeolocationPlugin
} from "@capacitor-community/background-geolocation";
const BackgroundGeolocation = Plugins.BackgroundGeolocation as BackgroundGeolocationPlugin;
```

## Installation
```sh
npm install @capacitor-community/background-geolocation
npx cap update
```

### iOS
Add the following keys to `Info.plist.`:

```xml
<dict>
  ...
  <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
  <string>We need to track your location</string>
  <key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
  <string>We need to track your location while your device is locked.</string>
  <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
  <array>
    <string>location</string>
  </array>
  ...
</dict>
```

### Android
Import the plugin in `MainActivity.java`:

```java
import com.equimaps.capacitor_background_geolocation.BackgroundGeolocation;

public class MainActivity extends BridgeActivity {
  @Override
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    // Initializes the Bridge
    this.init(savedInstanceState, new ArrayList<Class<? extends Plugin>>() {{
      // Additional plugins you've installed go here
      // Ex: add(TotallyAwesomePlugin.class);
      add(BackgroundGeolocation.class);
    }});
  }
}
```

Configure `AndroidManifest.xml`:
```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        <service
            android:name="com.equimaps.capacitor_background_geolocation.BackgroundGeolocationService"
            android:enabled="true"
            android:exported="true"
            android:foregroundServiceType="location" />
    </application>

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
    <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.location.gps" />
</manifest>
```

Configration specific to Android can be made in `strings.xml`:
```xml
<resources>
    <!--
        The channel name for the background notification. This will be visible
        when the user presses & holds the notification. It defaults to
        "Background Tracking".
    -->
    <string name="capacitor_background_geolocation_notification_channel_name">
        Background Tracking
    </string>

    <!--
        The icon to use for the background notification. Note the absence of a
        leading "@". It defaults to "mipmap/ic_launcher", the app's launch icon.

        If a raster image is used to generate the icon (as opposed to a vector
        image), it must have a transparent background. To make sure your image
        is compatible, select "Notification Icons" as the Icon Type when
        creating the image asset in Android Studio.
    -->
    <string name="capacitor_background_geolocation_notification_icon">
        drawable/ic_tracking
    </string>
</resources>

```

## Changelog

### v0.3.15
- On iOS, the status bar now turns blue whilst the location is being watched in the background. This provides the user a straightforward way to return to the app.

### v0.3.12
- Added the `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` permission. This is required for apps which target Android 12 (API level 31). A preceeding example shows how to add this permission to your app's manifest.
